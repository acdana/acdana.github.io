		<h2>General Education Reflection</h2>
		
		<p>Although I took many general education courses I would say that my Math 314 course was the most beneficial to me. 
		This was a Graph Theory course. I learned key concepts regarding graphs such as efficient traversal and search algorithms. 
		It was easily the most influential general education class that I took.</p>
		
		<p>Using the education I received at Iowa State University I will be working full time for the Principal Financial Group as an 
		application developer. While there I hope to further my education to eventually become a project manager.</p>
		
		<p>Although most of my general education courses did not directly relate to Engineering, they still were very helpful. 
		Whether it be my public speaking course or my children's literature course, my education taught me how to better communicate and work with others. 
		This is a huge benefit for me because better communication within an engineering team means better code and ultimately a better end product.</p>
		
		<h2>Cumulative Reflection</h2>
		
		<p>Iowa State University has been a great way for me to expand my knowledge and prepare for a job in the Software industry.</p>
		
		<p>I've had numerous classes where I have been given the freedom to design and implement my own software systems for a problem.</p>
		
		<p>There are also an abundant amount of group projects to work on. This has allowed me to work with diverse groups of people which 
		introduces new ideas and solutions to problems.</p>
		
		<p>Beyond collaborating with other students I have also been able to get help from experts such as Michael Kay, the developer of the 
		Saxon XSLT processor. I was having trouble with Saxon XQuery and he was able to lead me down the right path to correct my mistake.</p>
		
		<p>Lifelong learning is something that has really been ingrained in me during my time at ISU. One of the main factors for this would be 
		my time in the Physics club. Even though I changed my major I still enjoy physics and hope to continue learning more in the future. Also the wide availability 
		of online programs for learning new programming languages has made it easy for me to learn the basics of multiple languages which I hope to expand upon.</p>
		
		<p>Taking risks is something that is highly important in the software field. Risks allow for innovation and new ideas to turn into working 
		software. I am learning more about risk analysis at my internship with the Principal Financial Group. There are some instances where a risk simply is not worth 
		the possible fallout and other instances where risks should be taken to provide innovation and change.</p>
		
		<p>Overall if I was to go through the undergraduate program at Iowa State again there is not much that I would change. I would have liked 
		to see the addition of classes focusing more on the Agile methodology. I would also take a few more math classes in order to get my minor in mathematics. Lastly 
		I would like to see more classes focusing on large software projects such as those that one will encounter in industry. Teaching us how to understand and get up 
		to speed on already established large projects is something that is not done but is almost always required in industry.</p>
