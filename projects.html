		<h2>Senior Design Project</h2>
		<p>My Senior Design project is a web platform for Java specifications. What this means is that I am working to 
		create a web platform to create specifications for common Java libraries. This is being done with a social and technical side. The social 
		side is using a Question and Answer site to automatically post questions regarding specifications. We then retrieve and analyse the answers to 
		create a better specification.</p>
		
		<p>We are using Java and HTTP requests to communicate with a Question and Answer site to get specifications as well as to analyze them.</p>
		
		<p>My role on the team is web master and key concept holder. This means that I manage the website for the team (listed below) and have in depth knowledge
		on how our project is composed.</p>

		<h2>Other Projects</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>Algorithm Analysis (ComS 311 Project 1)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>For this project I set up a program to compare the average running times of multiple different widely used algorithms. </p>
					
					<p>I feel that this project had a big impact on my 
					understanding of the workings of different algorithms. Although I had used and written these algorithms before I had never had this 
					level of analysis on them. </p>

			</ul>
		  <li>Graph Theory (ComS 311 Project 2)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>This project was focused primarily on the implementation and traversal of graphs. We were to set up a weighted graph representing the city of Ames. 
					We were then given certain vertices that we needed to visit in a given order. Our job was to find the shortest path to visit all necessary vertices. </p>
					
					<p>Overall I learned a huge amount about graph theory by completing this project. 
					I had taken graph theory courses before but this was the first time that I had really been able to implement the theory and see it work on a larger scale 
					(upwards of 1500 vertices).</p>

			</ul>
		  <li>Software Design (CprE 339 Homework 9)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>For this project I implemented a calculator that used the state design pattern.</p> 
					
					<p>I found it extremely interesting how I was able to make extremely simple state cases that all tied together to form a more complex program.
					The state design pattern allowed for changes in my code to be made later (such as the addition of different operations) without much technical debt.</p>

			</ul>
		  <li>JDBC Application (ComS 363 Project 2)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>This program used JDBC to connect to a campus SQL database and query the information. In the program I 
					updated GPAs and classifications of students based on grades and credit hours. </p>
					
					<p>Although the code itself was not complex it did teach me valuable skills 
					when it comes to JDBC and using Java to manage a database. The skills and procedures I learned doing this project have helped me a lot with projects in 
					other classes as well as internships.</p>

		<h2>Resources I have used...</h2>
		<p>There are many resources that I have used throughout my college experience to help me with 
		my engineering problems. Office hours for both my professors as well as my TA's have been extremely useful. I also 
		have received a lot of help by just visiting the TLA and talking over problems with classmates.</p>
